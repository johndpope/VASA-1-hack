# VASA-1-hack
This cut of code is using sonnet 3.5 to reverse engineer code from white paper 
(this is for La Raza)

the models here seem to be ok -  it does train / converge
https://github.com/johndpope/MegaPortrait-hack/issues/36


## Status
this is fresh code spat out by sonnet 3.5 
the earlier ai models were maybe light on the training data for diffusion - 
this latest code seems to nail it.

I update progress here - https://github.com/johndpope/VASA-1-hack/issues/20


âœ… dataset is good
trainer in progress.
```
python dataset_testing.py 
 
python trainer.py --config configs/vasa.yaml --exp-name vasa_experiment
```




# VASA Classes Documentation

## Core Model Classes

### `PositionalEncoding`

class PositionalEncoding(nn.Module):
```
- Adds position information to transformer embeddings
- Arguments:
  - `d_model`: Dimension of model
  - `dropout`: Dropout rate

- Used for sequence position information in transformers

### `AudioEncoder`
```python
class AudioEncoder(nn.Module):
```
- Encodes audio features using Wav2Vec2 architecture
- Components:
  - Multiple convolutional layers
  - Layer normalization
  - Projection layer
- Processes audio input for the model

```python
class VASADataset(Dataset):
```
- Dataset implementation
- Features:
  - Video frame processing
  - Audio feature extraction
  - Face attribute extraction
  - Gaze and emotion processing

### `VideoGenerator`
```python
class VideoGenerator:
```
- Video generation pipeline
- Features:
  - Sliding window approach
  - Source image processing

## Diffusion Process

### `VASADiffusion`
```python
class VASADiffusion:
```
- Diffusion process handler
- Features:
  - Forward diffusion sampling
  - Reverse diffusion sampling
  - Beta schedule management

## Loss Functions

### `VASALoss`
```python
class VASALoss(nn.Module):
```
- Combined loss implementation
- Components:
  - DPE (Disentangled Pose Encoding) loss
  - Identity preservation loss
  - Reconstruction loss
  - Configuration for loss balancing

## Usage

Each class is designed to work together in the VASA pipeline:

1. Configuration is managed by `VASAConfig`
2. Data is loaded through `VASADataset`
3. Training is orchestrated by `VASATrainer`
4. Models (`VASAFaceEncoder`, `VASADiffusionTransformer`, etc.) process the data
5. `VideoGenerator` produces the final output
6. `Evaluator` assesses the results

## Notes

- Most neural network classes inherit from `nn.Module`
- The system uses PyTorch as its deep learning framework
- Classes support distributed training where applicable
- Extensive use of type hints for better code clarity
- Modular design allows for easy component modification
